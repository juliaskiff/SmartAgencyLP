# SmartAgencyLP
https://juliaskiff.github.io/SmartAgencyLP/SmartAgencyLP/index.html

This project was implemented during my studies at one of the online front-end development courses. Based on the lectures given by the course authors I made a responsive landing page layout using HTML, CSS, Less, Bootstrap 3, Jquerry and PHP technologies.
The psd mock-up was provided by the course authors.
As Less complier I used Winless.
Other technologies I used for the project:
•	Icons - http://fontawesome.io/ 
•	Slider Slick -  http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ 
•	Animation effects – animate.css - https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
