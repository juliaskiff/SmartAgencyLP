https://juliaskiff.github.io/SmartAgencyLP/SmartAgencyLP/index.html

This project was implemented during my studies at one of the online front-end development courses. 
Based on the lectures given by the course authors I made a responsive landing page layout using HTML, CSS, Less, Bootstrap 3, Jquerry and PHP technologies.

The psd mock-up was provided by the course authors.

As Less complier I used Winless.

Other technologies I used for the project:

 •	PhpMailer library - https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
  
 •	Animation effects – animate.css - https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ 

 •	Slick Slider  -  http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ 
  
 •	Icons - http://fontawesome.io/
